# DualConnectivityEEG
Between brains connectivity during social interactions using EEG to record brain activity

There are two main functions: calculate_plv_struct.m and calculating_PDC.m to calculate PLV and PDC connectivity metrics respectively but the data processing and plotting functions are not available yet. 

This is a working progress, building a GUI compatible with eeglab...coming soon!
